## Preamble:

The dataset is available at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency].

## Reseach questions:

1. to explore three data points, and visualize how they influence the energy load. 

The following variables **Wall.Area**, **Roof.Area**, **Glazing.Area** are identified as key indicators that can influence the energy load efficiency for both (Heating and Cooling spaces).

## Structure of analysis:

A time series forecast using the arima model as follows:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Plot Load Distribution Using Scatter Plot
3. Plot Heating Load Efficiency
4. Plot Cooling Load Efficiency
5. Plot Energy Efficiency

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# install packages if necessary
list.of.packages <- c("ggplot2", "forcats")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

# load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
```

```{r, comment= ""}
rm(list = ls())

sourceURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenElston/DataScience350/master/Lecture1/EnergyEfficiencyData.csv"

df <- read.csv( sourceURL, header = TRUE)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, comment= ""}
head(df)
```

```{r, comment= ""}
str(df)
```

Categorize useful variables and convert them to a categorical variables, namely **Orientation**, **Glazing.Area.Distribution**, and **Glazing.Area** (variance) variables.

```{r, comment= ""}
# change vector values to factor values
df$Orientation <- as.factor(df$Orientation) 

# attributes of variable 
levels(df$Orientation) <- c("North", "East", "South", "West")

# change vector values to factor values
df$Glazing.Area.Distribution <- as.factor(df$Glazing.Area.Distribution)

# attributes of variable
levels(df$Glazing.Area.Distribution) <- c("UnKnown", "Uniform", "North", "East", "South", "West")

# change vector values to factor values
df$Glazing.Area <- as.factor(df$Glazing.Area) 

# attributes of variable
levels(df$Glazing.Area) <- c("0%", "10%", "25%", "40%")
```

```{r, comment= ""}
summary(df)
```

## Plot Load Distribution Using Scatter Plot

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
# visualize if there is any relation between 'Roof.Area', 'Surface.Area' and 'Glazing.Area' and how load is distributed using scatter plot.
ggplot(df, aes(x = Cooling.Load, y = Heating.Load), alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_point(aes(colour = Roof.Area ))+
  facet_grid(Overall.Height + Glazing.Area ~ Surface.Area,  space = "free") +
  ggtitle("Load distribuiton of energy by Roof Area and Surface Area \n by Glazing Area and Overall Height")
```

Observations:

* Roof area and Surface area range is high for minimum/ lowest (3.5) over-all height and
* Roof area and Surface area range is low for maximum/ highest (7.0) over-all height.
* There are no data points when the overall height is 7 and highest surface area range and also for low overall height 3.5, we have no data points with the low surface area range.

## Plot Heating Load Efficiency

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# plot how 'Wall.Area' influence heating load using raster plot.
ggplot(df, aes( Surface.Area, Roof.Area)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = Heating.Load), interpolate = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "steelblue", high = "red")+
  facet_wrap(~Wall.Area, scales = "free" )+
  ggtitle('Measuring Heating Load distribution \n by Wall Area, Surface Area and Roof Area') +
  xlab('Surface Area') + ylab('Roof Area') +
  theme_classic()
```

Observations:

* By looking at the figures, we can conclude that **Wall Area** plays a significant role in heating, irrespective of Surface Area and Roof Area. (Higher the wall area, higher the heating load).

## Plot Cooling Load Efficiency

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# plot how 'Wall.Area' influence cooling load using raster plot.
ggplot(df, aes(Surface.Area, Roof.Area)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = Cooling.Load), interpolate = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "grey", high = "steelblue")+
  facet_wrap(~Wall.Area, scales = "free" )+
  ggtitle('Measuring Cooling Load distribution \n by Wall Area, Surface Area and Roof Area') +
  xlab('Surface Area') + ylab('Roof Area') +
  theme_classic()
```

Observations:

* So, **Wall Area** plays a significant role in both Heating and Cooling Load efficiency.

## Plot Energy Efficiency

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=7, warning=FALSE}
# we have seen more variation in load data when the overall height is (7.0). So lets create a subset named(energy.eff.sub7.0) which contains the filtered data with overall height = 7.0. Lets visualize, if the 'Roof.Area', 'Wall.Area', 'Surface.Area' and 'Glazing.Area' are influencing the load efficiency.
energy.eff.sub7.0 <- df[ df$Overall.Height ==7.0,]
ggplot(energy.eff.sub7.0,
       aes(x = Cooling.Load, y = Heating.Load, group = factor(round(Wall.Area)), 
           size = Glazing.Area,
           shape = factor(round(Wall.Area))))+
  geom_point(aes(colour= factor(round(Surface.Area))), alpha = 0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",se = TRUE )+
  facet_wrap(~ Roof.Area) +
  ggtitle('Load efficiency by Roof Area, by Wall Area by Surface Area and by Glazing Area') +
  theme_classic()
```

Observations:

* It is clearly evident that the Load efficiency is influenced by the Roof Area, Wall Area, Surface Area, and Glazing Area.
* When the Glazing Area is high, Roof Area is high and Wall Area is high, Load will be high and viceversa.
